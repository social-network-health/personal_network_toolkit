// Communications slot — the transport interface every comms transport
// implements. Sub-contracts CO-1 through CO-6 from `_pna_triage.md` Part 4.
//
// A Transport is a pluggable outreach mechanism — mailto, signal-cli, a
// Matrix bridge, a future P2P pubkey-based channel. The workspace surfaces
// the user's configured transports and lets the user pick per outreach
// (AC-16). The transport's only job is to launch the user's external
// client (or in-bundle handler) with the composed payload pre-populated —
// it MUST NOT send autonomously, and it MUST NOT read message content
// (AC-18). The workspace shows the full payload to the user before any
// transport is launched (AC-19); the transport sees what the user already
// approved.
//
// CO-3 (transport eligibility, AC-18) is enforced by the workspace's
// transport-registration logic: a candidate Transport whose mechanism
// could read message contents is refused at register time. The interface
// below describes the runtime contract; the eligibility check is a build-
// time / registration-time decision on top of it.
//
// CO-6: This interface is for *workspace-launched* user outreach. The
// distribution-mechanism's auth-link transport (Postmark in
// fellows_local_db's magic-link distribution flavor) is governed by the
// Distribution slot's contracts, NOT by this interface. They look similar
// — both deliver bytes to a user — but their AC sets and trust postures
// are different.
