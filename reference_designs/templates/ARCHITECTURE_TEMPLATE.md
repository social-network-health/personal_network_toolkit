# <design-name> — Architecture

> **Toolkit-Version:** 0.1 (draft) — the toolkit (spec, contracts, skill, lint, templates) is versioned as a unit; see [VERSION](../../VERSION).

> The Architecture document is this design's Security Target: a declaration of its conformance against the PNA Spec (which plays the Protection Profile role). PNT requires every accepted reference design to ship one. A row missing the Verification field in the AC attestation table below is grounds for PR rejection.

## Toolkit-Version

This design was built and validated against Toolkit-Version <X.Y> (the `/VERSION` minor, e.g. `0.1`), which fixes the version of the whole toolkit — spec, contracts, skill, lint, and templates — that this design conforms to.

## AC attestation table

For every AC in `spec/PNA_Spec.md § Universal architectural commitments` and every flavor-derived AC in `spec/axes.md` triggered by this design's picks, a row stating Realization, Verification, and Status. ACs the design declares not applicable are listed with a brief reason.

The Verification field is load-bearing — a row missing this field is grounds for PR rejection. Three kinds of verification are acceptable:

1. **Deterministic test** — a test file or script that decides conformance mechanically. Example: a script that scans the codebase for any `fetch(...)` call to a non-localhost URL on the Private DB code path.
2. **LLM evaluation rubric** — a prompt or rubric describing what an LLM should look for when evaluating this AC against the source. Useful for posture/intent ACs that mechanical tests can't reach. Example: "Read every code path that reads from Private DB and decide whether any of them sends data off-device. Cite specific call sites supporting the decision."
3. **Human-review note** — a short note explaining why no automated test is feasible, with the review record itself archived in the design's repo (e.g., `docs/conformance-review-2026-05.md`).

Mixed verification is fine — for example, "deterministic test (file-presence lint) plus LLM rubric (read transport handlers and confirm no SaaS broker is reachable)". Whichever combination, the Verification cell names them concretely.

**A `conformant` row needs executable evidence — a doc pointer is not evidence.** A doc that *asserts* a property does not *prove* it. If the only Verification you can name for a `conformant` row is a `*.md` file, either add a test, declare one of the three verification kinds above explicitly, or downgrade the row to `partial`/`Open`.

**Negative invariants need negative tests.** A row whose realization *forbids* something — "off-folder there is no durable private store", "no transport reads message contents", "the gated capability's write does not happen" — must cite a test that asserts the thing does **NOT** happen. The happy-path test ("X happens when enabled") does not cover the negative; over-claiming a negative is a silent conformance failure, the most dangerous kind because the suite stays green.

**Deferrals are strict-xfail tests, never code comments.** When an invariant is designed but not yet enforced, encode it as `@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True, reason="…PR-N…")` naming the PR that will satisfy it: it goes red the day the enforcement lands (prompting promotion to a hard guard), and `grep "xfail(strict"` is the live list of claimed-but-unproven invariants. A deferral parked in a `// TODO` or an `INERT` comment is unowned and evaporates — the only other home for one is an honest `partial`/`Open` status in this table.

**Mechanical check (recommended).** Ship a checker that parses this table and fails CI when a `conformant` row has no resolvable test and no declared review kind — so the table can't drift back into asserting properties the code never proved. Reference implementation (stdlib-only, ~90 lines): `test_attestation_has_evidence.py` — parse every table with `Verification` + `Status` columns; for each row whose Status contains `conformant` and not `partial`, require a resolvable `path/to/test.py[::name]` ref (file exists; if `::name`, a `def`/`class name` exists) or one of the declared review-kind keywords; a doc-only cell fails. The first PNT reference design (fellows_local_db) ships this checker alongside a Stop-hook that blocks a commit touching the attestation without touching tests, and a CLAUDE.md "Conformance discipline" stanza.

### Universal architectural commitments

| AC | Realization | Verification | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| AC-1 (two-store ownership split) | <how the design realizes it; file/code references> | <test file(s), LLM evaluation rubric, or human-review note> | conformant / partial-conformance / not-applicable |
| AC-4 (versioned cross-boundary handshake) | | | |
| AC-6 (always-reachable diagnostic escape) | | | |
| AC-7 (self-service field-debug substrate) | | | |
| AC-9 (auto-backup of private data) | | | |
| AC-10 (opt-in non-destructive re-imports) | | | |
| AC-11 (concurrent-access detection) | | | |
| AC-15 (build label tied to source revision) | | | |
| AC-16 (user-driven transport selection) | | | |
| AC-17 (sourced provenance) | | | |
| AC-18 (transports cannot read message contents) | | | |
| AC-19 (user-visible payload before send) | | | |
| AC-PRM-A (LLM calls over user data are transports) | | | |
| AC-PRM-D (re-ingestion is user-initiated) | | | |
| AC-MCP-A (cloud AI clients require per-call consent for Private DB) | | | |
| AC-MCP-B (MCP Communications stages; workspace launches) | | | |

### Flavor-derived architectural commitments

List the flavor-derived ACs triggered by this design's axis picks. Look these up in `spec/axes.md` based on the picks declared above. Add a row per triggered AC.

| AC | Triggered by | Realization | Verification | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <AC-N> | <axis-pick> | | | |

## Contributions to the spec

What spec changes (if any) this submission proposes, and what working code in the design demonstrates each:

- **<change 1>**: ... — demonstrated by `<file:line>` in the canonical repo.
- **<change 2>**: ... — demonstrated by `<file:line>` in the canonical repo.

If this is an additive submission (no spec changes proposed; the design simply attests against the current Toolkit-Version), say so: "No spec changes proposed; this submission attests conformance to Toolkit-Version <X.Y>."

## Reproducibility notes

Build/run instructions sufficient for someone to make a fighting attempt from the archived source.

- **Dependencies:** <list>
- **Build commands:** <list>
- **External services required (if any):** <list>
- **Known dependency-rot risks:** <if relevant, note packages or APIs that may be deprecated by the time this is read>

The goal is not "the design will always build" — it's that a future reader has enough information to recover the intent even when the environment has rotted.
