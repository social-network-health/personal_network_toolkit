# <design-name> — Architecture

> **Toolkit-Version:** 0.1 (draft) — the toolkit (spec, contracts, skill, lint, templates) is versioned as a unit; see [VERSION](../../VERSION).

> The Architecture document is this design's Security Target: a declaration of its conformance against the PNA Spec (which plays the Protection Profile role). PNT requires every accepted reference design to ship one. A row missing the Verification field in the AC attestation table below is grounds for PR rejection.

## Toolkit-Version

This design was built and validated against Toolkit-Version <X.Y> (the `/VERSION` minor, e.g. `0.1`), which fixes the version of the whole toolkit — spec, contracts, skill, lint, and templates — that this design conforms to.

## AC attestation table

For every AC in `spec/PNA_Spec.md § Universal architectural commitments` and every flavor-derived AC in `spec/axes.md` triggered by this design's picks, a row stating Realization, Verification, and Status. ACs the design declares not applicable are listed with a brief reason.

The Verification field is load-bearing — a row missing this field is grounds for PR rejection. Three kinds of verification are acceptable:

1. **Deterministic test** — a test file or script that decides conformance mechanically. Example: a script that scans the codebase for any `fetch(...)` call to a non-localhost URL on the Private DB code path.
2. **LLM evaluation rubric** — a prompt or rubric describing what an LLM should look for when evaluating this AC against the source. Useful for posture/intent ACs that mechanical tests can't reach. Example: "Read every code path that reads from Private DB and decide whether any of them sends data off-device. Cite specific call sites supporting the decision."
3. **Human-review note** — a short note explaining why no automated test is feasible, with the review record itself archived in the design's repo (e.g., `docs/conformance-review-2026-05.md`).

Mixed verification is fine — for example, "deterministic test (file-presence lint) plus LLM rubric (read transport handlers and confirm no SaaS broker is reachable)". Whichever combination, the Verification cell names them concretely.

**A `conformant` row needs executable evidence — a doc pointer is not evidence.** A doc that *asserts* a property does not *prove* it. If the only Verification you can name for a `conformant` row is a `*.md` file, either add a test, declare one of the three verification kinds above explicitly, or downgrade the row to `partial`/`Open`.

**Negative invariants need negative tests.** A row whose realization *forbids* something — "off-folder there is no durable private store", "no transport reads message contents", "the gated capability's write does not happen" — must cite a test that asserts the thing does **NOT** happen. The happy-path test ("X happens when enabled") does not cover the negative; over-claiming a negative is a silent conformance failure, the most dangerous kind because the suite stays green.

**Deferrals are strict-xfail tests anchored to an issue, never code comments.** When an invariant is designed but not yet enforced, encode it as `@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True, reason="…tracking: #NNN…")` carrying a machine-readable **issue** anchor — an issue, not a PR: issues close when the *work* is done; a PR closes when *something* merges, so a PR ref goes stale while the invariant stays unmet. A deferral parked in a `// TODO` or an `INERT` comment is unowned and evaporates — the only other home for one is an honest `partial`/`Open` status in this table.

Mind the asymmetry: `strict=True` trips the day the fix *lands* (it XPASSes, prompting promotion to a hard guard), but stays a contented green xfail *forever* if the fix is **abandoned** — so the marker catches accidental success, never silent abandonment (PRs closed, the invariant quietly dropped from scope). Two cheap reinforcements close that blind spot: **(a)** require the `tracking: #NNN` anchor above, and if your tracker can report issue state, flag any strict-xfail whose issue is **closed while the test still xfails** — that deferral was dropped, not done; **(b)** cap the deferral count low (a handful) so the honest-frontiers list (`grep "xfail(strict"`) stays glanceable and debt can't normalize. The fellows_local_db design ships both — an anchor lint and a report that probes issue state — in `tests/test_xfail_discipline.py`.

**Mechanical check (recommended).** Ship a checker that parses this table and fails CI when a `conformant` row's evidence isn't real — so the table can't drift back into asserting properties the code never proved. PNT ships a portable, stdlib-only reference implementation: [`tools/attestation-evidence-lint.py`](../../tools/attestation-evidence-lint.py) (with clean/dirty fixtures and a self-test). Copy it into your design and run it against your Architecture document + test tree. For each row whose Status contains `conformant` and not `partial`, it requires a resolvable `path/to/test.py[::name]` ref (file exists; if `::name`, a `def`/`class name` exists) **that is not decorated `xfail` or unconditional `skip`**, or one of the declared review-kind keywords. A doc-only cell fails; **a cited `xfail` test fails** — a declared-false invariant is not evidence (this is the exact seam where a row cited `xfail(strict=True)` as proof and the suite stayed green); a conditional `skipif` is exempt, as a real environment guard. The first PNT reference design (fellows_local_db) ships this lint alongside a Stop-hook that blocks a commit touching the attestation without touching tests, and a CLAUDE.md "Conformance discipline" stanza.

**Validation timing — non-conforming code must not reach users.** The lint above is the *deterministic* half of "exists **and passes**": a static check proves the cited test is a live, non-deferred assertion, but it cannot prove the test *passes* — that's the runtime layer. So run the suite (lint + tests) at the boundary where code becomes user-available, and require it finding-free there. Name your boundary: a project with a ship/deploy step gates there (fellows_local_db gates `deploy-preflight`); a continuously-deployed or merge-to-main-is-prod project gates per-PR; a library gates at release/tag. The cue to re-run is a **behavior change** — adding or removing a feature. The deferral cap is *secondary* hygiene between those runs, not the safety mechanism; the gate is.

## Contributions to the spec

What spec changes (if any) this submission proposes, and what working code in the design demonstrates each:

- **<change 1>**: ... — demonstrated by `<file:line>` in the canonical repo.
- **<change 2>**: ... — demonstrated by `<file:line>` in the canonical repo.

If this is an additive submission (no spec changes proposed; the design simply attests against the current Toolkit-Version), say so: "No spec changes proposed; this submission attests conformance to Toolkit-Version <X.Y>."

## Reproducibility notes

Build/run instructions sufficient for someone to make a fighting attempt from the archived source.

- **Dependencies:** <list>
- **Build commands:** <list>
- **External services required (if any):** <list>
- **Known dependency-rot risks:** <if relevant, note packages or APIs that may be deprecated by the time this is read>

The goal is not "the design will always build" — it's that a future reader has enough information to recover the intent even when the environment has rotted.
