# PNT User's Guide

The PNA Spec is the canonical specification; this guide is the canonical how-to. It gives step-by-step instructions corresponding to each of the success criteria listed in [`README.md` § Status](../README.md#status).

PNT is built to be consumed by AI coding agents. Most of this guide assumes you have an agent (Claude Code, Cursor, an equivalent) you can ask things like *"use the PNT skill to validate my design."* The skill at [`pna-build-eval-contrib/SKILL.md`](../pna-build-eval-contrib/SKILL.md) is the agent-consumption view of everything in this guide.

---

## Goal 1 — Build a conformant PNA

You're starting (or extending) a personal network application.

1. **Read the spec.** Start with [`spec/PNA_Spec.md`](../spec/PNA_Spec.md) end-to-end. The universal architectural commitments (ACs) are non-negotiable; the axes in [`spec/axes.md`](../spec/axes.md) are where you make choices.

2. **Pick your axes with an agent.** Open Claude Code in your project directory and ask:

   > "Use the PNT skill to walk me through axis picks for a [Directory Archive | Personal Relationship Manager | …] PNA."

   The agent walks each axis (distribution, storage substrate, ingestion shape, workspace shell, comms transport set, MCP-exposure) and the attested picks per axis.

3. **Find a reference design that shares as many of your picks as possible.** Each [`reference_designs/<name>/`](../reference_designs/) directory has a design record naming its flavor. Study the design closest to what you want. Its archived source is linked via the Software Heritage SWHID in the record.

4. **Pull the typed contracts.** [`contracts/`](../contracts/) has them. Each contract opens with a `Realizes: AC-X, AC-Y` header naming the ACs it serves. Treat the contracts as load-bearing; your code conforms to them.

5. **Author your Architecture document.** Use [`reference_designs/templates/ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md`](../reference_designs/templates/ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md) and put the result at `docs/Architecture.md` (or equivalent) in your design's own repo. Fill in PNA Spec version, axis picks and versions, per-axis implementation notes, and — most importantly — the AC attestation table. For every applicable AC, record (a) how your code realizes it and (b) what test/rubric/review-note verifies it.

6. **Build.** Implement the design against the contracts.

7. **Self-check.** Run the audit flow (Goal 2 below) on your own code before declaring the design done.

## Goal 2 — Audit a candidate PNA before installing it

You have a PNA in front of you (someone else's, or your own in-progress one) and you want an LLM to check whether it actually honors the PNA Spec — whether it's safe with your data.

1. **Get the candidate's source.** Clone the repo. If you only have a bundle, ask for the source.

2. **Open Claude Code in your PNT working directory** (this guide assumes you have PNT itself cloned alongside the candidate, or that PNT is reachable from the agent's working directory).

3. **Ask the agent to run the audit.** Use natural language:

   > "Use the PNT skill to audit `<path-to-candidate>` for PNA-spec conformance. Is this app safe for me to install?"

4. **Read the report.** The agent walks every applicable AC (universal + flavor-derived) and produces a structured AC-ID-keyed report:
   - `conformant` — design honors this AC; cited code locations included.
   - `non-conformant` — design violates this AC; the report names the AC requirement and the offending code.
   - `not-applicable` — design's flavor doesn't trigger this AC.
   - `unable-to-determine` — needs human review.

5. **Read the summary.** Non-conformances against Goals 1–5 (private-data sovereignty, source-mirroring honesty, transport security, durability, local diagnosability) are the load-bearing concerns. If any of those are non-conformant, the design is not safe to trust with your data.

6. **You may emphasize a specific concern.** E.g.: *"Focus on Goal 1 — make sure my Private DB rows can't leave my device."* This shapes the summary, not the underlying check.

---

## Goal 3 — Submit your design as a reference design

You've built (or are operating) a PNA and want to contribute it back to PNT. This is the most-used flow and gets the most space.

### Should I submit?

Three patterns are valuable enough to justify a submission:

- **New architectural commitment.** Your design surfaced a constraint the spec doesn't yet capture. Your PR will include a spec diff.
- **Existing patterns on a new platform.** Your design exercises existing ACs on a substrate or use-case not yet attested in the reference set. No spec change needed; your design expands the ecosystem.
- **Ecosystem value-add.** Your design fills a use-case gap, brings accessibility, or makes something easier that no existing design demonstrates.

If your design is *identical* to an existing reference with no novelty, reach out before authoring — the PR may not be worth the maintenance overhead.

### Step 1: Preflight your design with the skill

Open Claude Code in your design's repo (or in PNT, with a path to your design). Ask:

> "Use the PNT skill to validate this design for submission to PNT."

The agent will:

1. **Locate your Architecture document.** If it exists, validate it against the code. If it doesn't, walk you through creating one interactively, asking about each section (PNA Spec version, axis picks, per-axis notes, AC attestation rows).
2. **Ask what's interesting architecturally** about your design (one of the three patterns above).
3. **Report what's broken or missing** as a structured list — files, sections, Verification fields, cited-but-absent code, failing tests, license problems.

Iterate: fix things, re-run preflight, keep going until the report is clean.

### Step 2: Open the PR

Once preflight is clean, ask the agent:

> "Use the PNT skill's contribute flow to open a PR adding this design at `<path-to-design>` (commit `<sha>`)."

The agent will:

- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Author the design record at `reference_designs/<design-name>/README.md`.
- Copy your Architecture document to `reference_designs/<design-name>/Architecture.md`.
- Add the spec diff if you're proposing one.
- Open the PR via `gh pr create`.

### Step 3: Maintainer review

A maintainer reviews at the judgment-and-review layer (does the spec change make sense? does the Architecture document accurately describe the design? is the AC attestation table complete?). They may ask for changes — fix, push, repeat.

### Step 4: After merge — final validation

Once the PR is merged, run preflight one more time against the merged state. It should come out clean.

## Goal 4 — Archival via Software Heritage

You don't do anything here — it happens after your PR is accepted.

When the maintainer accepts your PR, they trigger Software Heritage archival on your repo at the accepted commit. The planned tooling is `tools/swh-save.sh <your-repo-url> <commit-sha>` (landing in Phase 5 of the reorganization plan); until then, archival is performed manually via Software Heritage's Save Code Now. The resulting SWHID (a `swh:1:dir:...` content-addressed identifier) is recorded in your design record at `reference_designs/<design-name>/README.md`.

This means your design's source survives even if your upstream repo is deleted or relocated. You don't need to do anything; the maintainer handles it. If they forget, remind them.

For high-signal designs, the maintainer may additionally mirror the design to a `pnt-archive` GitHub organization as a frozen fork. SWHID alone is sufficient for the archival promise; the fork is belt-and-braces.

---

## Goal 5 — Influence spec evolution

If you find a spec gap, ambiguity, or contradiction while building or operating your PNA, your PR includes a spec diff. The maintainer reviews the diff in the context of your demonstrating reference design.

After merge, the PNA Spec version is bumped per linear SemVer:

- **Patch** — clarifications, typo fixes
- **Minor** — additive changes (new ACs, new axes, new picks, new sub-contracts)
- **Major** — breaking changes (semantically altered ACs, removed picks, contract-shape changes)

Individual axes carry their own version (declared per-axis in each Architecture document). A breaking change to an axis bumps that axis's version and the spec major.

If you discover a gap after your design is already accepted, file a new PR with the spec diff and an updated Architecture document. Same workflow as the initial submission.

---

## Goal 6 — AC traceability in your design

Every architectural commitment in the spec has a stable ID (`AC-1`, `AC-MCP-A`, etc.). Every typed contract names the ACs it realizes via a `Realizes: AC-X, AC-Y` header. Every Architecture document maps each applicable AC to a verification mechanism.

Your job as a contributor: fill in the **AC attestation table** in your Architecture document. For each applicable AC, three fields:

- **Realization** — how the design's code realizes the AC, with code references (`file:line` or `module/function`).
- **Verification** — the specific test file, LLM evaluation rubric, or human-review note that verifies it for *your* design.
- **Status** — `conformant`, `partial-conformance` (with known gap), or `not-applicable` (with reason).

The Verification field is load-bearing. Three kinds are acceptable:

1. **Deterministic test** — a script or test file decides conformance mechanically. Example: a script that scans the codebase for any `fetch(...)` call to a non-localhost URL on the Private DB code path.
2. **LLM evaluation rubric** — a prompt or rubric describing what an LLM should look for. Useful for posture/intent ACs that mechanical tests can't reach. Example: *"Read every code path that reads from Private DB and decide whether any of them sends data off-device. Cite specific call sites."*
3. **Human-review note** — a short note explaining why no automated test is feasible, with the review record itself archived in the design's repo (e.g., `docs/conformance-review-2026-05.md`).

Mixed verification per AC is fine.

The lint at [`tools/lint-spec-ids.py`](../tools/lint-spec-ids.py) checks that every contract names at least one AC and that every claimed AC exists in the spec. CI runs it on every PR. (A future `tools/validate-architecture.py` will additionally lint your Architecture document for missing Verification fields; planned for Phase 6.)
