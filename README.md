# Personal Network Toolkit

The Personal Network Toolkit is a blueprint for building **[personal network applications (PNAs)](PNA_Spec.md)** — local-only apps for viewing contact data and working on relationship data over a firewalled private data layer. PNAs run on the user's device, never as SaaS, and bridge SaaS-held contact data into a private workspace.  **[Why do this?](PNA_Spec.md#preamble)**

When building a PNA, specs are foundational because users will increasingly compose software by prompting AI agents, and success is measured by adherence to them.

Three deliverables, in dependency order:

1. **Foundational specs.** Universal vocabulary, goals, axes, architectural commitments, and typed contracts for a PNA. — **shipping in v0.1 (draft)**.
2. **Production-ready reference applications.** Working PNAs you can install, study, and adapt. — first reference design is a distributed directory archive (lives at [richbodo/fellows_local_db](https://github.com/richbodo/fellows_local_db)).
3. **MCP servers.** Composability-layer (Software 3.0) bridges so AI clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, local Ollama agents) can drive a PNA on the user's behalf. — three v1 stdio servers ship inside `fellows_local_db/mcp_servers/`; typed contracts for all five canonical MCP servers live here in [`spec/contracts/`](spec/contracts/).

That combination best satisfies the composability model of Software 3.0 in this context. It should ensure that both the humans and the AIs in modern human-AI builder teams can build PNAs that they understand fully and that behave as expected. The Personal Network Toolkit augments the human-AI builder teams; it doesn't automatically build applications itself.

This toolkit augments human-AI builder teams; it doesn't auto-build applications itself; it is a blueprint for agents to implement and humans to customize and verify.  Verification is made simply by composable contract specifications made primarily for AIs, derived from goals made for humans to read.

## Entry points

Read in this order if you're new:

- **[`PNA_Spec.md`](PNA_Spec.md)** — universal PNA specification. Vocabulary, goals, use cases, axes, composition, universal architectural commitments, slot map with 57 sub-contracts, scope/versioning. **Start here.**
- **[`axes.md`](axes.md)** — the six Axes a PNA varies along, attested picks per Axis, and the flavor-derived ACs each pick triggers.
- **[`use_cases.md`](use_cases.md)** — attested classes of PNA (Directory Archive realized; Personal Relationship Manager draft; Multi-PNA ecosystem target).
- **[`spec/contracts/`](spec/contracts/)** — typed contracts for the load-bearing interfaces: JSON Schema for the worker init handshake + RPC protocol, OpenAPI for distribution auth, SQL DDL for the two database schemas, TypeScript for the Communications transport interface, JSON Schema for the five canonical MCP server tool surfaces.
- **[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)** — spec version history.
- **[`llms.txt`](llms.txt)** — discovery file for the spec (humans + AI agents land here cold).

## Reference designs

A reference design is a working, deployed PNA that demonstrates one valid combination of axis picks against the spec. Each lives in its own repository so it can ship under its own release cadence.

- **[fellows_local_db](https://github.com/richbodo/fellows_local_db)** — first reference design. Directory Archive use case. Flavor: `distribution:web-bundle-with-magic-link + storage:opfs-sqlite-wasm + ingestion:single-source-static-mirror + workspace-shell:vanilla-js-spa + comms:mailto-only + mcp-exposure:shared+private+comms`. Its [`docs/Architecture.md`](https://github.com/richbodo/fellows_local_db/blob/main/docs/Architecture.md) declares spec-version conformance and the per-slot specializations.

When a second reference design (e.g. a Personal Relationship Manager) lands, it'll be linked from here.

## Status

**v0.1 (draft).** Spec content is feature-complete for v0.1 — all universal ACs, axes, use cases, slot map with sub-contracts, and typed contracts are in place. Substantive changes from this point bump the spec version per [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

Reference implementations of the canonical MCP servers ship today in [`fellows_local_db/mcp_servers/`](https://github.com/richbodo/fellows_local_db/tree/main/mcp_servers) (Shared Data Ops, Private Data Ops, Communications). Ingestion and Diagnostics tool surfaces are spec-level placeholders awaiting first reference implementations.

## Plans

`plans/` holds long-form proposals for toolkit extensions. Today: [`memorize-plugin-plan-v0.2.md`](plans/memorize-plugin-plan-v0.2.md) — a plugin proposal.
