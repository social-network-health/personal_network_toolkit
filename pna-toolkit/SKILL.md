description: 'Use when building, extending, or evaluating a Personal Network Application (PNA) — local-first, private-by-default applications that mirror SaaS contact data into a user-owned workspace and operate on relationship data with no remote authority. Triggers on requests to build a local-first contact app, relationship manager, private CRM-like tool, or any app built around personal-network data; on requests to audit an existing application for PNA-spec conformance ("is this app safe to install?", "does my app conform?"); on requests to contribute back to the PNA Toolkit — either a reference design, or (the common case) a lighter toolkit fix to the spec/tooling/docs; and on requests to harden the operating environment a PNA runs in against runtime adversaries (an OS-level AI agent or another local process reaching the data out-of-band). Four flows: build a conformant PNA from the spec, evaluate whether an existing application conforms, contribute back to the toolkit (reference design or toolkit fix), and harden the environment a PNA runs in (advisory).'

# Building, Evaluating, and Contributing to PNAs

> **Toolkit-Version:** 0.2 — the toolkit (spec, contracts, skill, lint, templates) is versioned as a unit; see [VERSION](../VERSION).

A PNA is a local-first application built to the PNA Toolkit spec. The spec defines the architectural commitments (ACs) all PNAs share and the axes along which they legitimately differ. Conformance is satisfied by implementing the typed contracts in `contracts/` for each declared axis pick and honoring every applicable AC.

The PNA Toolkit itself is a *generative + evaluative* application-class blueprint:

- **Generative.** AI agents read it to build conformant PNAs. The spec + contracts + reference designs are the materials.
- **Evaluative.** AI agents read it to evaluate whether an existing application conforms. The user trusts the spec; they want to know whether a specific candidate honors it.

This skill covers four flows: **build**, **evaluate**, **contribute**, and **harden** (advisory). Use whichever the user's request fits. The first three secure what the *built PNA* does (checked by the ACs); **harden** secures the *operating environment* the PNA runs in (advisory — it recommends environmental countermeasures, adds no AC, awards no pass/fail).

## Build flow

Use when the user is starting or extending a PNA.

1. **Read the spec end-to-end first.** `spec/PNA_Spec.md` covers vocabulary, goals, axes, universal architectural commitments, and the slot map with 57 sub-contracts. The universal ACs are non-negotiable.
2. **Determine axis picks with the user.** Each axis has documented options in `spec/axes.md`. The axes in v0.1: distribution, storage substrate, ingestion shape, workspace shell, comms transport set, MCP-exposure. The spec uses variable language because the set may evolve.
3. **Enumerate inherited Constraints.** From the chosen axis picks, list every Constraint they inherit (`spec/constraints.md`, via each pick's `Triggered-by:` and the cross-references in `spec/axes.md`). For each, state the handling you will implement — per-platform capability reduction, "enough power to be useful, not enough to be dangerous" — and its frontier. A `web-bundle` × `opfs-sqlite-wasm` PNA inherits the full `CST-PWA-*` family; plan the folder-mode-vs-OPFS-only split and the honest non-Chromium messaging up front, not as an afterthought. A capability reduction MUST enforce at the data layer, not UI-only.
4. **Author an Architecture document for the design.** Use the template at `reference_designs/templates/ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md`. It declares the Toolkit-Version, axis picks and their versions, and per-axis implementation choices.
5. **Pull the typed contracts.** For each axis pick, the relevant contracts live in `contracts/`. Each contract opens with a `Realizes: AC-X, AC-Y` header naming the ACs it realizes. Treat the contracts as load-bearing — do not deviate without proposing a spec change (contribute flow).
6. **Find a reference design that shares axis picks.** Each `reference_designs/<name>/` directory has a record with the design's flavor and a Software Heritage SWHID linking the archived source. Study the design that's closest to what the user wants. Also read any **field notes** for your applicable ACs (`docs/field-notes/<AC-ID>.md`) — pitfalls + negative-invariant checklists harvested from prior designs, so you build against known gotchas instead of re-deriving them.
7. **Build against the contracts.**
8. **Fill in the AC attestation table for the design.** For every applicable AC, name (a) how the design realizes it, with code references, and (b) the specific test, LLM evaluation rubric, or human-review note that verifies it for this design. A `conformant` row needs executable evidence (a resolvable test) or an explicitly declared review kind — a bare doc pointer is not evidence. Enumerate each row's **negative invariants** and pin each with a **negative test**. This is required for any future contribution PR.
9. **Run the evaluate flow on the in-progress code as a self-check.**

## Evaluate flow

Use when the user wants to audit an application for PNA conformance — either someone else's candidate ("is this app safe to install?") or their own in-progress design ("does my app conform yet?"). Mechanics are the same in both cases; the user's framing tells you which ACs to emphasize.

Inputs: a candidate PNA's source tree (or a description sufficient to read its behavior), and either a declared set of axis picks (from an Architecture document, if present) or picks you can infer from the source.

1. **For each AC in `spec/PNA_Spec.md` that applies to the candidate's flavor**, decide conformance:
   - **Read the AC's field note first** (`docs/field-notes/<AC-ID>.md`, if one exists): the harvested pitfalls + negative-invariant checklist from prior designs tell you what to scrutinize and what a candidate is easy to pass *by accident*.
   - Read the relevant source files; trace the data flow or control flow the AC constrains.
   - Cite specific code locations supporting the decision.
   - If the candidate has an Architecture document with an AC attestation table, check that the declared verification mechanism actually runs and passes.
2. **For each conditional AC in `spec/PNA_Spec.md` § Conditional architectural commitments** triggered by the candidate's axis picks, do the same.
3. **For each typed contract relevant to the candidate's axis picks**, check that the candidate implements the contract correctly. Contract headers (`Realizes: AC-X, AC-Y`) tell you which ACs the contract serves.
4. **Attestation evidence audit — the Security Target is only as good as its executable evidence.** For each AC/CST the candidate attests `conformant`:
   - **Confirm the named test exists and passes.** A Verification that doesn't resolve to a real, passing test — or to an explicitly declared review kind (`human-review` / `LLM rubric` / `code inspection` / `by architecture` / `by bounding` / `by construction`) — is a finding, not evidence. A bare doc pointer is **not** evidence: a doc that *asserts* a property does not *prove* it.
   - **Enumerate the row's negative invariants** ("X must NOT happen"; "off-folder there is no durable private store") and confirm a **negative test** pins each. The happy-path test ("X happens when enabled") does not cover the negative — over-claiming a negative is a silent conformance failure.
   - **Deferred / partial / Open rows must carry an honest status.** A deferral that lives only in a code comment ("lands later", "inert for now") is itself a finding — it belongs in the attestation table or as a `@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True)` test carrying a `tracking: #NNN` **issue** anchor (an issue, not a PR — see the "Deferrals" note in `reference_designs/templates/ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md`). Mind the asymmetry: a strict-xfail trips only on accidental *success*, never on abandoned deferral — so a `conformant` row citing an `xfail` test is a finding, since a declared-false invariant is not evidence.
   - A portable checker for the first two bullets ships at [`tools/attestation-evidence-lint.py`](../tools/attestation-evidence-lint.py) (stdlib, fixture-tested). It is the *deterministic* half: it proves each cited test exists and is a live, non-`xfail`/`skip` assertion — but a static lint cannot prove the test *passes*. Confirm passing by running the design's suite at its user-exposure gate (ship / per-PR / release). A `conformant` row citing an `xfail` test is the textbook false-evidence case it catches.
5. **Detect and verify Exceptions** (see `spec/exceptions.md`). For each Exception the candidate can raise — declared in its Architecture document's exception attestation, or inferred from the source where undeclared:
   - **Caught & handled?** Confirm consent is obtained *before* the raise (EX-H2), a persistent non-PNA-mode signal is shown while active (EX-H3), and a runtime active-set explainer exists (EX-H4). Cite code/UX for each.
   - **Reversibility?** Read the `Reversible:` declaration; if `yes`, trace the `Reversal:` mechanism and decide whether the code/UX delivers a practical path back to PNA mode. Mode only — do not credit a handler that implies returning to PNA mode undoes prior disclosure (EX-H5).
   - **Consent reaches the human?** Where an agent/proxy can drive the app, check the handler makes a best-effort attempt to propagate consent to the ultimate human and does not let an intermediary self-consent (EX-H7).
   - **Strength profile accurate?** Check each dimension's class (EX-H8) against the code/UX; the lint already confirmed the classes are valid vocabulary — you judge whether they're truthful (e.g. nothing about the provider's behavior is claimed above `provider-asserted`).
   - **Floor respected?** Confirm no exception relaxes an [un-relaxable floor](../spec/exceptions.md) AC (AC-18 / AC-19 / AC-MCP-B) even with consent — an exception that names a floor AC in `Relaxes:` is malformed (the lint flags it deterministically). The floor keeps the human-review-before-send seam intact.
   - **Undeclared deviations.** You are the backstop: if the candidate departs from an AC or the PNA definition WITHOUT declaring an Exception, that is a silent (uncaught) deviation — a conformance failure. Flag it and name the `EX-*` it should have raised.
6. **Detect and verify Constraints** (see `spec/constraints.md`). For each Constraint the candidate's axis picks inherit:
   - **Detected honestly?** Confirm the app determines whether the ceiling is active using a sound signal for that constraint's `Detectability:` class (`feature-detect` / `empirical-probe` / `ua-sniff`). Flag capability checks trusted where presence ≠ usefulness ≠ permanence (M1) — e.g. trusting `showDirectoryPicker in window` for a *durable* store, or `persist()`'s boolean.
   - **Handled by capability reduction?** Confirm the app offers only what the platform can keep, and that any durability promise (badges, "saved" affordances) matches reality. The reduction must hold at the data layer — a gated capability whose write still happens (or whose RPC still succeeds from a console) is not reduced. Cite code/UX.
   - **Frontier honest?** Read the `Frontier:` declaration; confirm the design does not claim to `Solve` what it only `Mitigated`, and that a `Workaround:` (where claimed) actually exists in code/UX.
   - **Over-reach (the backstop).** If the candidate promises a capability the platform cannot keep WITHOUT acknowledging the ceiling — false durability — that is a silent conformance failure, the dual of an undeclared Exception. Flag it and name the `CST-*` it should have handled.
   Report each finding by `CST-*` ID.
7. **Detect and verify User-mediation** (see `spec/user_mediation.md`). Enumerate the candidate's **mediated boundaries** — every distinct path that mutates the Private store or egresses its data (private-data restore, group/tag/note edits, outreach, AI-proposed merges) — and at each verify the three properties, reporting per boundary by `UM-*`:
   - **UM-1 (no bypass)?** Confirm the path is refused except through the dispose gate, enforced **at the data layer** — a surface hidden while the underlying write/send still succeeds (from a console, or by driving the worker/RPC directly) is not mediated. A negative invariant: confirm a **negative test** pins it (the proposer path is *refused*, not merely unused).
   - **UM-2 (separation)?** Confirm the proposing surface (MCP / AI / importer) carries no actuation capability — a proposal is inert until the principal disposes it through a distinct, attributable action.
   - **UM-3 (legibility)?** Confirm the dispose surface renders the staged change/payload deterministically and human-readably (names, not opaque IDs) and escapes untrusted proposer strings. Legibility is bounded — it shows *what changes*, never certifies comprehension; where weaker than a related AC (a row-count delta vs. AC-10's orphan preview), confirm the design declares the **frontier** honestly.
   - **Undeclared bypass (the backstop).** A path that mutates or egresses without routing through the gate — or a proposer that can self-actuate — is a silent UM failure. Flag it by the `UM-*` property it breaks.
8. **Produce a structured report keyed by AC or EX ID.** The canonical form is the typed artifact at `tools/evaluate-report.schema.json` (JSON Schema). Emit an instance of that schema as the source of truth, then render the human-readable report as a *view* over it — don't hand-write the prose report and skip the artifact. Emitting the typed form is what makes two runs on the same candidate diffable (which ACs changed status). The canonical filename is `evaluate-report.json`; validate any instance with `python3 tools/report-fixtures-lint.py <path>` (`just report-lint`). Two producers are interchangeable: this LLM evaluate flow, or a cooperating design's own deterministic emitter declared in its `design.toml` `[verify].entrypoint` — when a design ships one (e.g. `fellows_local_db`'s `just evaluate-report`), prefer running it and validating its output over hand-emitting. **When a candidate ships several report files, confirm which one is a schema instance before trusting it** — a generically-named `report.json` is often a design-internal conformance readout, not this render contract (validate it and see). Per-AC status is one of:
   - `conformant` — with cited code locations.
   - `non-conformant` — with cited code locations showing the violation and the AC's stated requirement.
   - `not-applicable` — with reason (typically: the candidate's flavor doesn't trigger this AC).
   - `unable-to-determine` — with explanation; defaults to flagging for human review.

   Each finding may also carry `evidence` entries tagged by `source` (`deterministic` / `llm` / `human`). When a deterministic check in `tools/` (e.g. the egress lint) has run against the candidate, fold its output in as a `source: deterministic` evidence entry on the AC it bears on, so the deterministic and LLM layers land on one finding.
9. **Summarize at the top** (the artifact's `summary` object): overall posture and the most concerning non-conformances. Goals 1–4 are the load-bearing user-facing concerns — anything compromising ownership of the root (Goal 1), integrity-by-validation (Goal 2 — which absorbs sourced-data honesty and local diagnosability), protection from egress / private-data sovereignty / user-controlled communication (Goal 3), or durability against entropy and accidents (Goal 4) leads the summary. The `posture` reports **PNA membership** (the `pna-active` bit, `exceptions.md` § Concept): an app with an active exception reads **`not-pna-active`** (never `conformant`) — how honestly each exception is handled stays in the per-`EX-*` findings, never rolled into the top-line verdict.

Callers may ask you to emphasize specific Goals or axes at runtime (e.g., "focus on private-data sovereignty"). Treat that as a hint for the summary, not a structural variation.

## Contribute flow

Use when the user wants to change the toolkit itself. **Route the contribution first** — the two shapes carry very different weight:

> **Does the change impose a new contract a conformant design must satisfy** — a new or changed AC, a new sub-contract, a new axis pick?
> - **Yes → reference-design contribution.** A spec change is accepted only with a working design that demonstrates it. Heavyweight: preflight, design record, evaluate-report, Architecture copy, archival. See *Reference-design contribution* below.
> - **No → toolkit fix.** Tooling/lints, templates, this skill, docs, a CHANGELOG entry, or a spec note that *clarifies* or *declines* a commitment (imposes no new obligation). Lightweight — a normal PR, no reference-design attestation. **This is the common case: most PRs to the toolkit are toolkit fixes.** See *Toolkit fix* below.
>
> When unsure, ask: *does a design have to do anything new to stay conformant after this change?* If nothing does, it's a toolkit fix.

### Reference-design contribution

Use when the user has built or operated a PNA and wants to submit it back to the toolkit as a reference design — whether they found a spec gap and want to propose a fix, or they have a working design that adds ecosystem value at a flavor not yet attested. The flow has two phases: **preflight validation** (is the design submission-ready?) and **PR authoring** (open the actual PR).

#### Preflight validation

Before authoring the PR, validate that the design is submission-ready. This step is interactive — ask the user questions, walk them through gaps, iterate until clean.

1. **Locate the design's Architecture document.** Typically at `docs/Architecture.md` (or equivalent) in the design's own repo.
   - **If it exists**, validate it against the code. For each AC attested as `conformant`, check the cited code locations and confirm the realization matches. For each AC with a Verification mechanism declared, check that the cited test/rubric/note actually exists and (where automated) passes.
   - **If it doesn't exist**, walk the user through creating one interactively. Use `reference_designs/templates/ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md` as the template. Ask about each section in turn:
     - Which Toolkit-Version does the design conform to?
     - For each axis in `spec/axes.md`, which pick does the design use, and at which axis version?
     - For each axis, how does the design realize the pick? (Read the code to help fill this in.)
     - For each applicable AC (universal in `spec/PNA_Spec.md`, plus any conditional AC in `spec/PNA_Spec.md` triggered by the picks): how does the design realize it? What test/rubric/note verifies it?

2. **Ask the user what's interesting architecturally about this design.** Three patterns are valuable enough to justify submission:
   - **New architectural commitment.** The design demonstrates a constraint the spec doesn't yet name. (Most valuable — the PR includes a spec diff.)
   - **Existing patterns on a new platform.** The design exercises existing ACs on a substrate or use-case not yet attested in the reference set. (Valuable — no spec change needed; the design's flavor expands the ecosystem.)
   - **Ecosystem value-add.** The design fills a use-case gap, brings accessibility, or makes something easier that no existing design demonstrates. (Valuable.)

   If the design fits any of these patterns, encourage submission. If it's purely identical to an existing reference with no novelty, surface that and ask what motivated the submission — if nothing surfaces, the PR may not be worth the maintenance overhead.

3. **Report what's broken or missing** in a structured list. The user needs to address these before the PR will be accepted:
   - Missing files (Architecture document, design record)
   - Missing sections in the Architecture document
   - Missing Verification field on any row of the AC attestation table
   - A `conformant` row whose only evidence is a doc pointer (doc-only is not evidence) or an undeclared verification kind
   - A `conformant` row whose cited test is `xfail` or unconditionally `skip` — a declared-false/unrun invariant is not evidence (`tools/attestation-evidence-lint.py` flags it; a conditional `skipif` guard is fine)
   - A negative invariant ("X must NOT happen") with no negative test pinning it
   - A deferral living in a code comment instead of the attestation or a `strict=True` xfail; or a strict-xfail with no `tracking: #NNN` issue anchor
   - AC realizations whose cited code doesn't match the claim
   - Failing or missing tests on the Verification side
   - A missing or malformed `design.toml` manifest — no `[verify]` entrypoint declared, a `[flavor]` pick that doesn't resolve in `spec/axes.md`, or (once `archival = "archived"`) a missing/malformed SWHID
   - License problems (must be OSI-approved; must permit Software Heritage archival)

4. **Iterate.** When the user fixes things, re-run preflight. Keep going until the report is clean.

#### PR authoring

Once preflight passes:

1. **Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`** for the acceptance rules.
2. **Frame the contribution.** If proposing a spec change, write the spec diff and explain what working code in the design demonstrates each change. If purely additive (no spec change), say so in the design record's contributions section.
3. **Author the design record** at `reference_designs/<design-name>/README.md` per `reference_designs/templates/TEMPLATE.md`.
4. **Author the machine-readable manifest** at `reference_designs/<design-name>/design.toml` per `reference_designs/templates/design.toml`. This is the source of truth the conformance suite reads: `name`, `repo`, `toolkit_version`, `status`, `archival`, the `[flavor]` axis picks (each must resolve in `spec/axes.md`), and the `[verify]` block declaring the one command that builds and runs the design's attested tests (`tools/lint-spec-ids.py` validates the shape). While archival is still pending, leave `commit`/`swhid_rev`/`swhid_dir` empty (`archival = "pending"`); the lint permits that for an in-flight design.
5. **Copy the Architecture document** to `reference_designs/<design-name>/Architecture.md`. (The toolkit keeps its own copy at acceptance time; the design's own repo may evolve after.)
6. **Open the PR** with: spec diff (if any), design record, `design.toml`, Architecture document, the evaluate-flow report at `reference_designs/<design-name>/evaluate-report.json` (a `tools/evaluate-report.schema.json` instance — from this evaluate flow or the design's deterministic `[verify].entrypoint` emitter; `just report-lint` green), canonical repo URL, and the commit SHA being submitted.

After merge, the maintainer triggers Software Heritage archival on the design's repo at the accepted commit (planned tooling: `tools/swh-save.sh`, landing in Phase 5; until then, archival is performed manually via Software Heritage's Save Code Now), then records the returned `swh:1:dir`/`swh:1:rev` and the commit SHA **into `design.toml`** and flips `archival = "archived"` (at which point the lint requires those fields and checks `swhid_rev` against `commit`). The SWHID also goes in the prose design record. A final preflight run against the merged state should come out clean.

A builder using Claude Code can drive both preflight and PR authoring end-to-end. Maintainer review at acceptance time is the human-judgment gate that's intentionally not automated.

### Toolkit fix

Use when the change is to the toolkit's own artifacts and imposes **no** new contract on a design — a lint or tool, a template, this skill, the docs, a CHANGELOG clarification, or a spec/scope note that *declines* or *clarifies* a commitment. No design record, no evaluate-report, no attestation. The canonical example is [PR #19](https://github.com/richbodo/personal_network_toolkit/pull/19): an at-rest-encryption *scope decision* that declined to add an AC — a spec touch that imposed no obligation, so no reference design was needed.

1. **Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md` § Contribution types](../CONTRIBUTING.md).**
2. **Make the change.** Keep any spec touch to a clarification or scope-decline. If you find yourself adding an obligation a design must satisfy, stop — you're back on the reference-design path.
3. **Lint green** — run `just ci` (the spec/contract/manifest lint plus the fixture self-tests; CI-enforced).
4. **Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry.**
5. **Record the rationale if it's a decision.** A toolkit fix that *chooses a direction* (adds or declines something, with reasoning worth preserving) appends an entry to [`docs/PriorArt.md` § Design notes](../docs/PriorArt.md) — the recurring log of toolkit-change rationale for contributions that aren't reference designs. A pure typo/mechanical fix doesn't need one.
6. **Open the PR.** Check the **Toolkit fix / docs / tooling** box in the Type section and complete the toolkit-fix checklist; no reference-design checklist applies.

## Harden flow

Use when the user wants to secure the **operating environment** their PNA runs in — not the app's own conformance (that's *evaluate*), but the runtime around it: an OS-level AI agent that can read files, another local process that can open the DB, a shared machine. Harden is **advisory** — it recommends environmental countermeasures and reports what is covered vs. exposed; it adds no AC and awards no pass/fail. The line the toolkit draws: *app security is `build` / `evaluate` / `contribute`; environment security is `harden` / advise.* What a built PNA must do lives in the ACs; securing the environment it runs in — compensating controls, monitor-and-respond, echoing NIST CSF *Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond* — is this flow.

Background and catalog: [`spec/exceptions.md` § Environmental threats and the Harden flow](../spec/exceptions.md) and its [§ Countermeasure library](../spec/exceptions.md). An *environmental threat* is the third source of pressure on a PNA's guarantees (alongside Constraints and Exceptions): an adversary in the runtime — detected, not user-`raise`d, and mitigated in the user's environment where the app's code has no reach.

1. **Identify the environment and its hazards.** With the user, characterize where the PNA runs and which runtime adversaries it is exposed to: OS-automation AI agents with filesystem / MCP reach, other local processes that can open the store, shared or multi-user machines, long-lived MCP client sessions that over-pull. Each is an environmental threat — arriving like a signal/interrupt from outside the app's control flow.
2. **Map each hazard to the Countermeasure library.** Read the **environmental** rows of `spec/exceptions.md` § Countermeasure library. For each applicable countermeasure, report its **strength class** (the EX-H8 vocabulary — `enforced` / `verifiable` / `best-effort` / `provider-asserted` / `recoverable-only` / `none`) and its demonstrator. The catalog seeded from the data-protection-vs-OS-automation research (R3): **sandbox the agent / `denyRead`** the store; run the PNA **under a separate OS user**; an **MCP access broker with per-request / JIT grants**; a **honeytoken + watchdog** ("claw trap") for detect-and-respond; **human-presence gating**. (At-rest encryption stays deprecated — mediate the access path or detect the intrusion while preserving the PNA's tool-readability, don't encrypt the bytes.)
3. **Name the PNA-intrinsic analogs.** Some hazards already have an in-app guard the built PNA provides — e.g. AC-MCP-A's per-call consent is the intrinsic analog of an external MCP broker. Tell the user where the app already covers the hazard so they don't double-pay; environmental countermeasures fill the gap the app's code cannot reach.
4. **Report the Protect / Detect / Respond posture, honestly.** For the user's environment, state which countermeasures are **in place**, which **apply but aren't**, and what is **still exposed** — each with its strength class, so `best-effort` and `recoverable-only` are not read as "solved." The output is advisory: no grade, no AC status.
5. **Advise, don't mandate.** The user mitigates in their own environment; the toolkit's value is telling them *which* countermeasures work and are appropriate (complex to know), not requiring one. Where a countermeasure could become a PNA-intrinsic AC, that is a *contribute*-flow proposal (demonstrator-gated per `CONTRIBUTING.md`), not a Harden output.

## Capturing a conformance lesson (field notes)

When you implement or harden a feature to satisfy an AC and its tests pass — especially after adversarial hardening — that is the moment a generalizable lesson is both *real* (a green test proves it load-bearing) and *fresh*. Capture it so the next builder/evaluator doesn't re-derive it:

1. **Identify the AC(s)** the just-green work bears on (from the diff + the tests).
2. **Split generalizable from design-specific.** The generalizable lesson → an AC-keyed **field note** at `docs/field-notes/<AC-ID>.md` (per its [`README`](../docs/field-notes/README.md) format); the design-specific "how we did it" stays in the design's own repo (its design note / Architecture).
3. **Draft from the session + the diff + the negative tests**, linking each negative invariant to the test that pins it. The `/capture-lesson` command runs this procedure.
4. **Honest decline.** If there is no generalizable lesson, say so in one line — never manufacture a note.

**Standing rule (PR-checklist-enforced).** A PR that adds or changes a feature to satisfy an AC, with tests now passing, links the field-note entry it added/updated — or checks "no generalizable lesson" with a one-line why. The bounded trigger (AC-driven *and* test-backed) keeps it sustainable; the honest decline keeps it from manufacturing noise. Full rationale: [`docs/design-notes/2026-06-capturing-conformance-lessons.md`](../docs/design-notes/2026-06-capturing-conformance-lessons.md).

## Principles to honor in every flow

- **Layering of verification.** Deterministic tools (lints in `tools/`) for the mechanical layer; LLMs (you) for the architectural-conformance layer; humans for judgment-and-review at PR time. Investment is ~80/20 toward description-and-process; the toolkit does not ship a Python conformance test runner beyond trivial lints.
- **The AC is the unit of identity.** Every AC has a stable ID. Every contract names the AC(s) it realizes. Every Architecture document attests AC-by-AC. When citing non-conformance, cite by AC ID.
- **Conformance is checked, not awarded.** There is no certifying body. A user trusts an app because they (or an LLM running this skill) checked it against the spec, not because the app carries a badge.
- **Lessons are captured AC-keyed, not lost.** Hard-won, generalizable conformance knowledge from a reference design lands in `docs/field-notes/<AC-ID>.md` and is read by the build/evaluate flows above — see § Capturing a conformance lesson.
- **Variable language about axis counts.** The spec says "the axes," not "the six axes." The set may evolve; don't hardcode numbers.

## Key resources

- `spec/PNA_Spec.md` — canonical spec (vocabulary, goals, ACs, slot map, sub-contracts)
- `spec/axes.md` — axes, attested picks per axis, and the `RZ-*` realizations + constraints each pick brings (it links up to the conditional ACs in `spec/PNA_Spec.md` they entail)
- `spec/constraints.md` — platform/substrate ceilings (`CST-*`) inherited by axis picks; the dual of exceptions.md
- `spec/user_mediation.md` — the third general mechanism: user-mediation (`UM-*`), the actuation invariant (proposer stages, principal disposes; UM-1/2/3)
- `spec/use_cases.md` — attested classes of PNA (Minimum Viable PNA, Directory Archive, PRM [draft], Multi-PNA ecosystem [target])
- `contracts/` — typed contracts (JSON Schema, OpenAPI, SQL DDL, TypeScript), each with a `Realizes: AC-X` header
- `reference_designs/README.md` — index of accepted reference designs
- `reference_designs/templates/` — the per-design record, Architecture, and `design.toml` manifest templates
- `reference_designs/<name>/design.toml` — the machine-readable design record (SWHID pin, flavor, verify entrypoint) the conformance suite consumes; see `plans/conformance-suite-plan.md`
- `tools/evaluate-report.schema.json` — typed artifact for the evaluate flow's AC-keyed report (the canonical, diffable output; the prose report is a view over it)
- `tools/egress-lint.py` — deterministic private-data-sovereignty check (AC-1): static scan for unsanctioned off-device egress vectors; `--json` emits evidence that folds into the report schema above. Run it against a candidate and fold its evidence into the AC-1 (and AC-2, server-side) finding.
- `tools/lint-spec-ids.py` — checks AC ↔ contract traceability invariants
- `docs/field-notes/<AC-ID>.md` — AC-keyed lessons harvested from reference designs (pitfalls + negative-invariant checklists); read before judging/implementing that AC
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — full contribution rules
- `docs/PriorArt.md` — survey of related work (annotated source list in `docs/PriorArtReferences.md`)
