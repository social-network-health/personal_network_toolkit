# Toolkit-Version: 0.2
"""Lint the AC/EX ↔ contract traceability invariants and toolkit-version stamps.

Checks:
  1. Every AC in spec/PNA_Spec.md and spec/axes.md carries a stable ID
     (AC-N, AC-PRM-X, AC-MCP-X).
  2. Every contract file in contracts/ declares "Realizes: AC-..." somewhere
     in its head (within the first ~25 lines), naming at least one valid AC.
  3. Every AC named in a contract's "Realizes:" header actually exists in the
     spec.
  4. Every Exception in spec/exceptions.md carries a stable ID (EX-*) in a
     registry table row.
  5. Every "Relaxes:" header (in exceptions.md) names only valid AC IDs, EX
     IDs, or the PNA-DEFINITION sentinel — and names no un-relaxable-floor AC
     (AC-18/19/MCP-B; § Scope discipline): a floor AC in a Relaxes is a malformed
     exception, since the floor may not be relaxed even with consent.
  6. Every "Reversible:" field is well-formed (yes|no); a "yes" requires a
     "Reversal:" field. Every value in a strength-profile column is one of the
     fixed strength classes (EX-H8).
  6b. Every Constraint in spec/constraints.md carries a stable ID (CST-*) in a
     registry table row AND a matching '### CST-...' detail block (same set of
     IDs on both sides). On both the table and the blocks: every "Triggered-by:"
     token resolves to a pick of the *named* axis (axis prefix + pick family
     from axes.md — a cross-axis pick does not resolve); every "Bounds:" token
     is a valid AC/Goal-N/PNA-DEFINITION; every "Frontier:" is well-formed
     (Open|Mitigated|Solved-on-<platform>|Inherent), and Mitigated/Solved-* each
     require a "Workaround:"; every "Detectability:" is one of the fixed classes.
     The table and the blocks must agree on every field per entry (no drift).
  7. The toolkit is versioned as a unit: a /VERSION file is the source of
     truth, and every versioned toolkit artifact (spec, skill, lint,
     contracts, templates, CONTRIBUTING, README) carries a "Toolkit-Version:"
     header whose minor matches /VERSION.
  8. Every reference_designs/<name>/design.toml is well-formed: required keys
     present; status/archival from their fixed vocab; [flavor] picks resolve to
     the right axis in axes.md; [verify] runner known. An `archived` design must
     carry a 40-hex commit + well-formed swhid_rev/swhid_dir (swhid_rev matching
     the commit) + a verify entrypoint; a `pending` design may defer those but
     any present value must still be well-formed. A design dir with an
     Architecture.md must have a manifest.
  9. Every 'Goal N' reference resolves to a goal the spec defines (a '### Goal N'
     heading in PNA_Spec.md), checked on the AC table's 'Serves' column, constraints'
     'Bounds:', and exceptions' 'Stresses:'; and no AC's 'Serves' names more than two
     goals (the primary + at-most-one-cross-cut cardinality cap).
  10. Every RZ-* realization in spec/axes.md (a row in a table with an 'RZ' ID
     column) names the AC(s) it realizes in a 'Realizes' column, and each named AC
     is a defined AC — the realization-layer analog of the contract 'Realizes:'
     check. A realization is Layer 2 and is never itself an AC (it carries no AC-*
     ID); it must point up at the Layer-1 commitment it realizes.
  11. The user-mediation mechanism (spec/user_mediation.md — the third general
     mechanism, alongside Exceptions and Constraints): every AC named in its
     'Unifies:' header resolves to a defined AC (so a renamed/retired AC cannot
     silently dangle the mechanism). UM-1/2/3 property IDs are counted for the summary.

The lint validates the *shape* of declarations (presence + ID/vocabulary/
version resolution), not their behavioral correctness — that is the LLM
evaluate flow's job (see pna-toolkit/SKILL.md § Evaluate flow).

Exits 0 if clean, 1 if any violation found. Designed to be CI-friendly.
